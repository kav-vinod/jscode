    <!-- best practice - put script element at the end of the body
        1. Browser parses file from top to bottom; if browser is busy parsing and executing JS code, web page will be slow to load = bad user experience
        2. In case some elements the script element uses needs to talk to other elements, by putting SE at end we can be sure that those elements exist

    <script

        //above line means source code is in index.js 
        //js goes in script
        //HTML - content (how page looks like)
        //JS - behavior (ex. what happens when your mouse hovers over a button? Does sth pop up?)
